This project is intended to be a clone of the web-based drawing game
[skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io), since skribbl.io has several usuability
issues. This project will try addressing as many of the usuability issues
as possible.

Even though there is an official instance at
[scribble.rs](https://scribble.rs), you can still host your own instance.

The site will not display any ads or share any data with third parties.

## Building

Currently there are no external dependencies, therefore the application can
simply be installed via `go get github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs`.

It should run on any system that go supports as a compilation target.

This application uses go modules, therefore you need to make sure that you
have go version `1.11` or higher and the environment variable `GO111MODULE`
set to `on`.
